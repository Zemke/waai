## TODO

- All images in the dataset originate from SingleNet.
  - Therefore `bg` from SingleNet runs should remain associated to the class.
    I.e. when SingleNet classifies sheep,
    `bg` from that inferencing should remain associated to the sheep.
    There could be a directory structure like `dataset/sheep/{0,1}/*.png`.
- Git LFS for dataset and models?
  - `alllogs`, `allreplays`
  - Keep all captures from `/getvideo` runs.
    They can be used to train the RPN later.
    Keep association to weapon.
  - Backups, too.
- Environment variables:
  - epochs
  - batch size
  - CPU/GPU
